# MY FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS FOR SEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER 2024
I decided to tell a story about my last year finances as a data analyst.
One of the decisions I made last year was to take a record of all my cash flow to the least currency. I tried many times and failed. I decided to learn and grow through the process. Today I am happy that I have become conscious about putting down all my financial activities no matter how small.
Today I decided to analyze the last 4 months of 2024.

**[DATASET AND ANAYLSIS](my-account-analysis.xlsx)**

## INSIGHTS I UNCOVERED:
1. Almost all my income went into expenses including part of my life savings
2. I spent so much on data with not much income generated with the data
3. transportation was taken so much from me.
4. It is good to have good friends who can always support you in your lowest moment
5. I invested in myself so much which caused noticeable growth in my income

## SOME ADVICE I GAVE TO MYSELF:
1. reduce your spending
2. save more money for future investments
3. Increase your income flow and sources
4. My savings are not for expenses.
5. family is everything

I don't know who this is for. But I know that if you take time to analyze your finances, life will be a lot easier for you.
